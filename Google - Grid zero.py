Grid Zero

=========



You are almost there. The only thing between you and foiling Professor Boolean's

plans for good is a square grid of lights, only some of which seem to be lit up.



The grid seems to be a lock of some kind. That's interesting. Touching a light

toggles the light, as well as all of the other lights in the same row and column

as that light.



Wait! The minions are coming - better hide.



Yes! By observing the minions, you see that the light grid is, indeed, a lock.

The key is to turn off all the lights by touching some of them. The minions are

gone now, but the grid of lights is now lit up differently. Better unlock it

fast, before you get caught.



The grid is always a square. You can think of the grid as an NxN matrix of

zeroes and ones, where one denotes that the light is on, and zero means that the

light is off.



For example, if the matrix was



1 1

0 0



Touching the bottom left light results in



0 1

1 1



Now touching the bottom right light results in



0 0

0 0



...which unlocks the door.



Write a function answer(matrix) which returns the minimum number of lights that

need to be touched to unlock the lock, by turning off all the lights. If it is

not possible to do so, return -1.



The given matrix will be a list of N lists, each with N elements.

Element matrix[i][j] represents the element in row i, column j of the matrix.



Each element will be either 0 or 1, 0 representing a light that is off, and 1

representing a light that is on.



N will be a positive integer, at least 2 and no more than 15.

def answer(matrix):
    # This solution uses linear algebra (who ever thought I would find use
    # for it again after college) to find the answer. For this to work, note
    # that the initial condition of each light is the result of starting from
    # an empty grid (all lights off) and pressing buttons. This results in
    # a system of equations which can be used to solve the problem.


    # First we 'define' a variable to each initial light condition (on = 1,
    # off = 0). Create a similar variable for the switch on each position that
    # is required to obtain the initial state of lights (value 1 = switch is
    # used, 0 = switch not used). Note that a switch only takes two values since
    # pressing a switch twice has no net effect to the state of the board.
    # This suggests that we can apply a modulo 2 field to all our operations as well.

    # Now for every light variable, the initial value of the light is equal to the sum
    # of switches pressed in that column and row (and then modulo 2). This results
    # in a system of equations that has a matrix representation as seen in the matrix M below.
    # If the length of the board is even, this matrix is invertible and a single solution
    # exists (with the modulo 2 field applied). Luckily, the inverted matrix equals itself
    # so the solution is obtained by simply multiplying M with the initial state to obtain
    # which switches need to be pressed, and summing the resulting vector.

    # For a board with odd length, the matrix is non-invertible and no single solution
    # exists. The trick is to augment the board with an extra row and column to make
    # the board length even again. However, our solution can then include switches only
    # included on the augmented board. Restricting these switch variables from turning 1
    # is the key to success.

        # and initial state as a function of switches simultanously (which is is possible
